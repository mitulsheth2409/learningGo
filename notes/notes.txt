1) go build <file-name.go> 
--> only compile the code, this creates an executable file. This file can
then be directly executed using ./<file-name>

2) go run <file-name.go> --> compile and run the code

3) There are two types of packages in go
--> Executable - Generates a file that we can run. A package with name 'main'
is an executable package. No other name will create an executable package
--> Reusable - Code used as helpers, e.g. libraries
